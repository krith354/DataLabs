Instructions:

	"Try to find the worst cases for each sorting(except HeapSort)"
	
Bubble Sort:
	This sorting algorithm's worst case is O(n^2). The array can be in descending order when asked for ascending.
	
	
Selection Sort:
	This sorting algorithm's worst case is O(n^2). The array can be completely unordered. 
	
	 
Insertion Sort:
	This sorting algorithm's worst case is O(n^2). The array can be completely unsorted huge 
	different gap between the numbers. 
	
	
Comb Sort:
	This sorting algorithm's worst case is O(n^2). The array can be completely unsorted huge 
	different gap between the numbers.
	
	
Cocktail Sort:
	This sorting algorithm's worst case is O(n^2). The array can be specifically order ascending to descending 
	till the middle of the array and vice-versa from there on.
